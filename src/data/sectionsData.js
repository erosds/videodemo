      "Imagine you want to discover <strong>new materials</strong>. You would start from existing ones and change their structure one at a time, testing each variation to see if it has the desired properties. This is <strong>slow and expensive</strong>. Now, imagine if you had a tool that could optimize the entire process, accelerating the discovery of new materials with desired properties. This is where <strong>AI comes in</strong>.",
