    subtitle: 'Imagine you want to discover new materials. You would start from existing ones and change their structure one at a time, testing each variation to see if it has the desired properties. This is slow and expensive. Now, imagine if you had a tool that could optimize the entire process, accelerating the discovery of new materials with desired properties. This is where AI comes in.',
